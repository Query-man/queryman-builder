Ordinarily any condition is used within data manipulation statements, like
SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT. Also, some other statements may use condition also,
for example CHECK.

The condition is representing by interface `org.queryman.builder.command.Conditions`.

In considering SELECT .. WHERE clause, lets look at the below query:
[source,java]
include::{example}[tag=select-where]

Each condition is succession of operands are joined by operator. For convenience's sake
any conditions may take a String object, but internally  each operand represents
the `Expression` object.

The conditions may be more complicated, including a `org.queryman.builder.Query`
object:
[source,java]
include::{example}[tag=select-where-query]

If you wish to specify a precedence of conditions (surround them by parentheses),
itâ€™s possible to do using grouping conditions:
[source,java]
include::{example}[tag=select-where-complex]
