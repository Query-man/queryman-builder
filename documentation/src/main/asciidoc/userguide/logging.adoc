Queryman Builder uses the log4j2 as a logger framework. So, the experienced
person in `log4j2` will have not problem to configure it.

Queryman Builder provides a base configuration of logging for particular things:

=== Logging for bootstrapping:
[source,xml]
include::{boot}[]

=== Logging for building a SQL and binding parameters.
[source,xml]
include::{ast}[]


=== Completed configuration of the logger.
[source,xml]
include::{completed}[]
