```
UPDATE [ ONLY ] table_name [ * ] [ [ AS ] alias ]
    SET { column_name = { expression | DEFAULT } |
          ( column_name [, ...] ) = [ ROW ] ( { expression | DEFAULT } [, ...] ) |
          ( column_name [, ...] ) = ( sub-SELECT )
        } [, ...]

Queryman builder implements almost all clauses of UPDATE statement, except WITH.
Common example is:
[source,java]
include::{example}[tag=simple-update]

It's also allowable for building a PrepareStatement:

[source,java]
include::{example}[tag=prepared-update]
