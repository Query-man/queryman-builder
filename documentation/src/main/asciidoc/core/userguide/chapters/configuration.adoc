=== Configuration
include::../../../variable.adoc[]

For now Queryman {version} does not provide wide possibilities in configuration.
Thus the xml configration below is optional. There are several ways provide configuration into Queryman: +

The first is via xml configuration as show below
[source, xml]
include::../../{mainResourcesDir}/org/queryman/queryman-configuration-1.0.xml[]

Second way is using `ConfigBuilder`
[source,java]
include::{mainJavaDir}/boot/configuration/ConfigBuilder.java[tags=config-builder]
