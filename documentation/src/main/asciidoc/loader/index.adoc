Queryman comes with a few modules {coreDocs}/index.html[`org.queryan.core`],
{builderDocs}/index.html[`org.queryan.builder`] etc. Each of them is needed a different
configuration from different  configuration files.

This process is done by Loader `org.queryman.loader`. The list below show loading's flow:

1. Trying to load xml file. If it done the configuration is retained.
2. Trying to load properties file. If it done the configuration is retained.
3. When the above trow steps fail, an exception `FileNotFoundException` is raised.

The configuration is stored in the `Properties` object.  To get it, call `getConfiguration()` method.

== Examples

* Set properties configuration file.
[source, java]
include::./../{mainJavaDir}/loader/LoaderExample.java[tag=load-properties]
* Set xml configuration file:
[source, java]
include::./../{mainJavaDir}/loader/LoaderExample.java[tag=load-xml]
* Set both configuration files:
[source, java]
include::./../{mainJavaDir}/loader/LoaderExample.java[tag=load-both]
