Queryman Builder provides a simple, intuitive SQL builder for PostgreSQL databases.
 It keeps a fluid SQL API that allows to build a query in object
 oriented way, such as:

[source, java]
```
include::{selectExamples}[tag=simple-select]
```

Or
[source, java]
```
include::{selectExamples}[tag=simple-select2]
```

It's also possible to get a PreparedStatement, passing a Connection object
to `buildPreparedStatement` method:
[source, java]
```
include::{selectExamples}[tag=select-prepare]
```
